### How to Play
The player is a turtle and can move up and down. There are crabs and fish that move towards the turtle and of the screen. If the turtle collides with a crab the score in the top right corner will decrese by 1. If the turtle collides with the fish the score will increase by one.

The purpose for creating this game was to learn how to use Python Arcade. This is the first game I have made using Python Arcade so the game is very simple. 

The following link is an overview of the code and a demonstration of the game being played.
